# Resume Downloads Feature

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE (February 1, 2026)

The resume downloads execution feature is fully implemented and tested. Downloads are now executed automatically, not just identified.

## Overview

The resume downloads feature provides robust state management for download operations, allowing downloads to be resumed after interruptions from system crashes, network failures, or application restarts. The system executes actual downloads using the ParallelDownloader and tracks progress in real-time.

## Architecture

### Components

1. **DownloadInfo Model** - Extended database model with comprehensive state tracking
2. **StateManager** - Manages download state transitions and locking
3. **ResumeSupport** - Handles HTTP range requests and partial file validation
4. **ResumeHelper** - Shared functionality for resuming downloads
5. **resume-downloads Command** - CLI command to manually trigger resume operations

### Database Schema

The `DownloadInfo` model has been extended with the following fields:

- `bytes_downloaded` - Progress tracking for partial downloads
- `total_bytes` - Expected total file size
- `resume_token` - Server-specific resume identifier (ETag, etc.)
- `retry_count` - Number of retry attempts
- `last_retry_at` - Timestamp of last retry
- `locked_at` - Lock timestamp to prevent concurrent downloads
- `locked_by` - Instance/process that acquired the lock

### State Machine

Download states:
- `pending` - Download queued but not started
- `downloading` - Download in progress
- `paused` - Download paused (can be resumed)
- `completed` - Download finished successfully
- `failed` - Download failed
- `retrying` - Download being retried after failure

## Usage

### CLI Commands

#### Resume Downloads Command

```bash
# Resume all incomplete downloads
stalkeer resume-downloads

# Preview what would be resumed (dry-run)
stalkeer resume-downloads --dry-run --verbose

# Resume up to 10 downloads with 5 concurrent workers
stalkeer resume-downloads --limit 10 --parallel 5

# Resume only failed downloads, skip pending
stalkeer resume-downloads --max-retries 3

# Clean stale locks before resuming
stalkeer resume-downloads --clean-stale-locks

# Filter by service (accepts radarr/sonarr or movies/tvshows)
stalkeer resume-downloads --service radarr
```

#### Integration with Radarr/Sonarr

The separate `radarr` and `sonarr` commands have been removed and unified into a single `download` command. Resuming incomplete downloads and tier-2 upgrades are now handled automatically by the scheduler (`downloads.force_tier_probability`) rather than an explicit `--resume` flag:

```bash
# Download missing movies and TV episodes from Radarr and Sonarr
stalkeer download --limit 20 --verbose
```

### Configuration

Add these settings to `config.yml`:

```yaml
downloads:
  # Resume downloads settings
  resume_enabled: true  # Enable resumable downloads
  progress_interval_mb: 10  # Persist progress every N megabytes
  progress_interval_seconds: 30  # Persist progress every N seconds
  lock_timeout_minutes: 5  # Consider locks older than this stale
  max_retry_attempts: 5  # Maximum retry attempts before giving up
```

## How It Works

### Download Lifecycle

1. **Initialization**: Download record created in database with `pending` status
2. **Lock Acquisition**: Process acquires lock to prevent duplicate downloads
3. **State Transition**: Status changes to `downloading` with timestamp
4. **Progress Tracking**: Progress persisted at intervals (every 10MB or 30 seconds)
5. **Completion**: Status changes to `completed`, lock released
6. **Failure**: Status changes to `failed`, retry count incremented

### Resume Process

1. **Query Database**: Find downloads in incomplete states (pending, downloading, paused, failed)
2. **Filter**: Exclude downloads exceeding max retry limit or locked by active processes
3. **Cleanup Stale Locks**: Remove locks older than timeout (default 5 minutes)
4. **Validate Partial Files**: Check if partial downloads exist and are valid
5. **Attempt Resume**: Use HTTP range requests where supported
6. **Fallback**: Restart download from beginning if resume not supported

### HTTP Range Request Support

The system automatically detects if servers support HTTP range requests:

1. Send HEAD request to check for `Accept-Ranges: bytes` header
2. If supported, send GET request with `Range: bytes=START-` header
3. Server responds with `206 Partial Content` and remaining data
4. If not supported, restart download from beginning

### Lock Mechanism

Prevents multiple processes from downloading the same file:

- Lock acquired before download starts
- Lock includes timestamp and instance identifier
- Stale locks (older than timeout) automatically cleaned up
- Lock released on completion or failure

## Error Handling

### Retryable Errors

- Network timeouts
- Server unavailable (5xx errors)
- Rate limiting (429)
- Connection errors

### Non-Retryable Errors

- Invalid URL (4xx errors except 429)
- File not found (404)
- Corrupted partial files
- Disk space errors

### Retry Strategy

- Initial retry: 2 seconds delay
- Exponential backoff with max 30 seconds
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Maximum retry attempts configurable (default 5)

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Logging

Enable verbose logging for detailed information:

```yaml
logging:
  app:
    level: debug  # Enable debug logging
```

Log messages include:
- Download state transitions
- Lock acquisition/release
- Progress persistence
- Retry attempts
- Resume operations

### Statistics

The `resume-downloads` command provides statistics:

```
Resume operation completed:
  Total: 15
  Resumed: 12
  Failed: 2
  Skipped: 1
  Duration: 2m34s
```

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Downloads not resuming
- Check database for download records
- Verify locks aren't stale
- Check server supports range requests

**Issue**: Downloads restarting from beginning
- Server may not support HTTP range requests (fallback behavior)
- Partial file may be corrupted (automatic cleanup)

**Issue**: Stale locks preventing downloads
- Run with `--clean-stale-locks` flag
- Adjust `lock_timeout_minutes` configuration

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Resume Operations**: Schedule periodic `resume-downloads` runs to ensure all media is downloaded
2. **Monitor Retry Counts**: High retry counts may indicate persistent issues with specific URLs
3. **Disk Space**: Ensure adequate disk space for partial downloads (stored in temp directory)
4. **Timeout Configuration**: Adjust lock timeout based on average download times
5. **Concurrent Downloads**: Balance `max_parallel` setting with network bandwidth and server limits

## Troubleshooting

### Check Download State

Query database to inspect download records:

```sql
SELECT id, status, retry_count, bytes_downloaded, total_bytes, error_message
FROM download_info
WHERE status != 'completed'
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;
```

### Manual Lock Cleanup

If needed, manually clean stale locks:

```sql
UPDATE download_info
SET locked_at = NULL, locked_by = NULL
WHERE locked_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '5 minutes';
```

### Reset Failed Downloads

Reset downloads to retry:

```sql
UPDATE download_info
SET status = 'pending', retry_count = 0, error_message = NULL
WHERE status = 'failed' AND retry_count >= 5;
```

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements:
- Checksum verification for partial downloads
- Distributed download coordination (multiple instances)
- Bandwidth throttling
- Download prioritization
- Web UI for download management
- Notification system for completion/failure

## Testing

Run tests for resume functionality:

```bash
# Run all downloader tests
go test ./internal/downloader/... -v

# Run specific test
go test ./internal/downloader -run TestStateManager -v

# Run with coverage
go test ./internal/downloader/... -cover
```

## API Integration

While the resume feature is primarily CLI-driven, the StateManager can be used programmatically:

```go
import "github.com/glefebvre/stalkeer/internal/downloader"

// Create state manager
sm := downloader.NewStateManager(downloader.DefaultStateManagerConfig())

// Get incomplete downloads
downloads, err := sm.GetIncompleteDownloads(ctx, maxRetries, limit)

// Acquire lock
err = sm.AcquireLock(ctx, downloadID)

// Update state
err = sm.UpdateState(ctx, downloadID, models.DownloadStatusDownloading, nil)

// Update progress
err = sm.UpdateProgress(ctx, downloadID, bytesDownloaded, totalBytes)

// Release lock
err = sm.ReleaseLock(ctx, downloadID)
```
