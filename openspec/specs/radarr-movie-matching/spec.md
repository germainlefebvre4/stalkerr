## Purpose

Radarr movie matching links Radarr's tracked movies to this system's database records using the most reliable identifier available, preferring TVDB ID and falling back to TMDB ID or fuzzy title/year matching so movies are correctly associated even when some identifiers are missing.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Radarr Movie struct captures TVDB ID from API
The `radarr.Movie` struct SHALL include a `TvdbID int` field mapped to the `"tvdbId"` JSON key from Radarr's REST API response, so the TVDB ID is available for database matching.

#### Scenario: TVDB ID is parsed from Radarr response
- **WHEN** Radarr's API returns a movie object with `"tvdbId": 12345`
- **THEN** the parsed `radarr.Movie.TvdbID` field SHALL equal `12345`

#### Scenario: Missing tvdbId field defaults to zero
- **WHEN** Radarr's API returns a movie object without a `"tvdbId"` key
- **THEN** `radarr.Movie.TvdbID` SHALL equal `0` and no error SHALL occur

### Requirement: download radarr uses TVDB ID as primary match key
The Radarr-fetch stage of the unified `download` command SHALL pass `movie.TvdbID` to `MatchMovieByTVDB` so the TVDB-primary key path is used when available, falling through to TMDB-ID and fuzzy title matching only when `TvdbID == 0`.

#### Scenario: Movie matched by TVDB ID when available
- **WHEN** a Radarr movie has `TvdbID = 12345` and a `Movie` record exists in the database with `tvdb_id = 12345`
- **THEN** the command SHALL match that record with confidence 100% via the TVDB-primary path

#### Scenario: Falls through to TMDB ID when TVDB ID is zero
- **WHEN** a Radarr movie has `TvdbID = 0` and a `Movie` record exists with the matching `tmdb_id`
- **THEN** the command SHALL match via the TMDB-ID path

#### Scenario: Falls through to fuzzy matching when both IDs miss
- **WHEN** a Radarr movie has `TvdbID = 0` and no `Movie` record matches its `TMDBID`
- **THEN** the command SHALL attempt fuzzy title+year matching as the final fallback
